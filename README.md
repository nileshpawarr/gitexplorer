The data folder (inside the src directory) is where you will be operating from. The three files you should be concerned with are the `primary-options.ts`, `secondary-options.ts` and `tertiary-options.ts` files.

These three files are responsible for the options a user can pick.

`primary-options.ts` contains an array of objects responsible for the options of the first select box.
`secondary-options.ts` contains an object. This object houses an arrays of objects (a mouthful ðŸ˜„), this is responsible for the second set of options a user sees when they select a primary option.
`tertiary-option.ts` file is responsible for cases where there needs to be a third & final select box.

###### Steps to add a new command

0. Create and Checkout to a new branch.
1. Add an object to the array in the `primary-options.ts` file with localised content
